                <h1>Gazelle Systems</h1>
                <p>
                    In 1985, the enterpreneurial bug bit me. Around March, I decided I would start my own company.  I had written a
                    file manager named <cite>FileEase</cite> while at Delstar Corp (using <cite>Turbo Pascal</cite> -- I loved that product!), 
                    but I was frustrated with the company and realized I had to leave. 
                    I wanted to create a much better file manager, but make it 10x faster. I had heard a lot about the C programming language
                    and figured that was the ticket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it was off to the races. I had very little money, and figured I would be able to just barely make it to the end of
                    the year before my money ran out. So in about 9 months, I taught myself C, 8088 assembly language, DOS internals, and
                    learned several BIOS hooks. I also had to figure out some undocumented DOS calls. And then we were ready to launch our
                    first product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I relied on my dad for some marketing tips for our first ad. He asked me, "Eric, if you really think this new product
                    of yours is so great, why don't you offer a double-your-money-back guarantee?" So I thought, hmmm... why not? And so we did.
                    We actually ran an A/B split with our first InfoWorld ad. The first ad was a double-your-money-back ad. The second was
                    a bit different: if you didn't like our product, tell us and we will refund your money and buy you the competitor's product
                    of your choice (a dangerous thing, as one of our competitors was priced at 3x our price).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was gutsy, but I knew that one of two things would absolutely happen:
                    <ol>
                        <li>We would get noticed immediately, and ...</li>
                        <li>We would either go bankrupt quickly, or soar</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We soared! And we got into lots of debt, barely hung on, 
                    and then sold the company for a song. I got just over $30k for my ownership, after turning down an option a year
                    before that would have netted me around $9 million (live and learn, that's what life's about, right?!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was surprised to find there's quite a bit of information about this great company available online.

                <p>
                    In nine months, I figured out how to program, doing things nobody else had done before.
                    I also created a marketing campaign,
                    learned how to manufacture diskettes and packaging, and launched the company. But the product was,
                    in fact, 10x faster than just about any other product out there when reading the directory structure
                    from the disk. I also figured out a very fast sorting algorithm (a modified comb sort) that, on those
                    wimpy 8086 computers, outperformed any other sort algorithm I could find such as heap sort, q-sort, several
                    others.

                <p>
                    It was exhausing, but I still remember when our red phone rang with the
                    first order based on the ad we launched in InfoWorld... exhilarating!!  The phone worked until our
                    puppy chewed through the cord; this was our first IT disaster, so we traced the problem,
                    said "<em>Bad dog!</em>", spliced the cord, and waited for the next phone order.

                            I designed the look and feel and the guts of this program. The screenshots are definitely retro, but it brings back fun
                            memories. People told me it was cool that the highlight bar seemed to float over the vertical column lines, and it
                            was super quick. It took a while to get the logic for the Directory Map, but customers loved it. Directories and subdirectories
                            were new concepts, hard for most people to understand. And that's one of the main reasons I wrote <cite>Q-DOS</cite>... to be
                            able to help people understand them (today, most everyone calls 'em folders).

                <h4>Everybody needs to backup...</h4>
                <p>
                    We needed a second product, since we now had a working distribution channel. Next on my list: a solid backup product. And it had
                    to be fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Memory was scarce in those days (mid to late 1980s), everything had to fit in 64k of memory (you could use extended memory, but there were
                    many potential solutions, some of which even worked!) One of the tricks I learned is that if I used assembly language,
                    my code would be smaller than otherwise, leaving more RAM available for file buffers; and more and larger buffers, with an
                    intelligent algorithm, could always speed up the process substantially.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I used the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.desmet-c.com/">DeSmet C compiler</a> which allowed me to switch in and out of C and assembly
                    language, which I totally loved doing. So I was able to write, debug, and create Gazelle's second product quite quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Total elapsed time to conceive, design, build, debug, test, and ship: 2 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, I got my hands on some Intel reference books (they weighed a couple pounds each) so I could figure out how to program
                    the floppy-disk controller and the DMA chip. After about the 50th time thru around 100 pages, it finally started to sink in,
                    and I was able to more than quadruple the speed of backups by overlapping read and write I/O. Very, very cool technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also conceived of and designed a test (that Intel quickly asked for) that detected flawed DMA chips thru software; 
                    seems under certain conditions when overlapping reads and writes, the data would shift by one byte position on a sector 
                    about to be written... nasty!

                            Yeah, it was fast. It was fun learning to talk directly to the floppy controller in assembly language.
                            At one time <cite>Back-It</cite> was the fastest floppy-controller-based backup on the planet (maybe even the solar system!).
                            In fact, our team made fun of what I kept saying about speed, so they presented me with a specially-
                            monogramed Speedo swimsuit that said on the back "<em>Because speed is everything!</em>". I never wore 'em, somehow they 
                            must have gotten thrown away.
