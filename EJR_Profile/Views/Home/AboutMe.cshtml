                </h2>
                <p>Welcome to my personal website!  This is the first website I've built, and it's a work in progress.</p>
                <h4>Coder Foundry Bootcamp is Torture!</h4>
                <p>I'm currently enrolled in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coderfoundry.com/masterclass/">Coder Foundry Masters Bootcamp</a>
                    in Charlotte, North Carolina. I'll update this site
                    as the weeks go by... assuming I'm still alive and have kept all my wits (my hair?? that's another story!).
                    By the end of September I will have added intermediate proficiency of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
                    C#, MVC, ASP.NET, and other technologies to my professional programming background.
                </p>
                <h4>Professional Technologies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in 32- and 64-bit assembly language (especially the <a target="_blank" href="http://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> dialect)</li>
                    <li>Proficient in C, C++; some proficiency in Java</li>
                    <li>Increasing proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 at Bootcamp</li>
                    <li>Proficient in coding and making things go fast, fastER, and FASTEST!!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I am an expert regarding what goes on inside the CPU. 
                    I understand key performance issues related to memory, 
                    CPU cache structures, Intel instruction sets, and file systems and storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coding is my personal favorite because I love making things go fast. 
                    Focusing on performance issues is one of my strong points. 
                    In a couple of projects 
                    (here in the <span>@Html.ActionLink("JavaScript exercises", "JS_Exercises", "Home")</span>) 
                    you'll see how I improved 
                    the speed of one solution by about 50x
                    compared to the approach used by most programmers.
                </p>
                <h4>Working with People</h4>
                <p>
                    I love working with people! I love to help and teach others. 
                    I can be a great team player but also work well on my own. 
                    I've been in charge of, and in the middle of, some incredible development teams. 
                    I've managed dozens of programmers (I know all their tricks, and have some of my own!). 
                    I love my family, and I’ve enjoyed living in Utah for the past 40 years. 
                    And because I have ties to family in many different states now,  I’m up for a new adventure! 
                </p>
                <h4>I'm Ready!</h4>
                <p>
                    So... although I've been an entrepreneur in the past, it's time to come back to my programming roots. 
                    I love technology (I have <span>@Html.ActionLink("8 U.S. patents in my name, and several more pending","IP","Home")</span>). 
                    I love making things go fast. I love working. And I also love to jump
                    into the unknown, to find ways to make things better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's not all, here are some bonus <span>@Html.ActionLink("fun facts about me","Other","Home")</span>.
