                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal website! It's my first ever, and it's a work in progress. I try to make weekly updates,
                    and have a couple major updates with two projects
                    (<a href="http://aardvark-ejr.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Aardvark</a> and
                    <a href="http://ejr-carfinder.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">CarFinder</a>)
                    that you'll see on my @Html.ActionLink("Portfolio", "Portfolio") page; I'll have those updated by Tuesday (Sept. 1).
                </p>
                <h3>Coder Foundry Bootcamp</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently enrolled in the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coderfoundry.com/masterclass/">Coder Foundry Masters Bootcamp</a>
                    in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are now in the 9th week of this concentrated 12-week web-dev bootcamp.
                    We started with a grueling agenda in HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript basics, then quickly added C#, MVC, Razor, and
                    a host of other technologies. We've been working on the front end, the back end, and in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel confident with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, and LINQ.
                    I'm finishing up my bug-tracker and car-finder apps and will
                    post them soon. We've added Web API and AngularJS, and so by the end of September I will have added a
                    substantial amount of web technologies to my profile.
                </p>
                <h3>Professional Technologies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in 32- and 64-bit assembly language (especially the <a target="_blank" href="http://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> dialect)</li>
                    <li>Proficient in C, C#, C++; some proficiency in Java</li>
                    <li>
                        Proficient in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, MVC, Entity Framework, Code-First Migrations,
                        LINQ, SQL, Razor, AngularJS, Web API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strong background in performance related issues:
                        <ul>
                            <li>CPU internals (Intel architecture), including CPU cache and memory</li>
                            <li>Intel instruction sets</li>
                            <li>File systems and storage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I know what goes on inside the CPU. I know how to use cutting-edge and legacy
                    languages, frameworks, and other technologies to eliminate bottlenecks and produce results. And I've learned how
                    to deliver what people really want (which is often times different from what they ask for).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love pushing the envelope, making things go fast. 
                    I have @Html.ActionLink("8 U.S. patents in my name, and several more pending", "IP", "Home").
                    And I love jumping into the unknown, figuring out how to make things better and more unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Working with People</h3>
                <p>
                    I thoroughly enjoy coding, and I love working with people! I love helping and teaching others.
                    I'm a great team player, and also work well on my own.
                    I've been in charge of, and in the middle of, some incredible development teams.
                    I've managed many dozens of programmers (I know their tricks, and have some of my own).
                    I love my family, and I’ve enjoyed living in Utah for the past almost four decades.
                    With family ties across the country, from California to Texas to Pennsylvania, 
                    I’m open to a new adventure with the right company.
                </p>
                <h3>I'm Ready!</h3>
                <p>
                    So... I've been an entrepreneur in the past, and I'm enjoying expanding my technical coding skills right now.
                    I'm looking for the right position in an entrepreneurial company, whether small, medium, or large.
                    Any company that does NOT advance in entrepreneurially-minded ways will eventually be disrupted
                    by those that innovate; I've disrupted in the past, and I'm ready to do it again!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wherever I go, I bring a unique combination of technical know-how and
                    an entrepreneurial can't-die attitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you haven't heard enough about me, here are some @Html.ActionLink("other fun facts","Other","Home") about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s talk! The fastest way to reach me is by e-mail.
                    I'd love to learn how I can contribute to your company, solving perplexing problems
                    and creating innovative solutions.
                    And if speed and performance are an issue for your company, then contact me AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
