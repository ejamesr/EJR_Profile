                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal website! It's my first ever, and it's a work in progress. Today (Aug 31) I just updated
                    the links to the mid-term projects <a href="http://aardvark-ejr.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Aardvark</a> and
                    <a href="http://ejr-carfinder.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">CarFinder</a>                    
                    that I created while at Coder Foundry's Master Bootcamp; they're also linked
                    on my @Html.ActionLink("Portfolio", "Portfolio") page. I'm adding extra functionality to Aardvark and should
                    be updating this again within the next 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h3>Coder Foundry Bootcamp</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently enrolled in the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coderfoundry.com/masterclass/">Coder Foundry Masters Bootcamp</a>
                    in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are now in the 9th week of this concentrated 12-week web-dev bootcamp.
                    We started with a grueling agenda in HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript basics, then quickly added C#, MVC, Razor, and
                    a host of other technologies. We've been working on the front end, the back end, and in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel confident with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, and LINQ.
                    I'm still adding functionality to Aardvark, my software bug-tracker app. We've added
                    Web API and AngularJS to our portfolio (you'll see the results in my
                    <a href="http://ejr-carfinder.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">CarFinder</a> app),
                    and tomorrow we start our final project. I can't believe how
                    much I've learned and have been able to do at this incredible bootcamp.
                </p>
                <h3>Professional Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to my programming background since the late 1980s, I've learned quite a bit about
                    what goes on inside the CPU. I know how to use cutting-edge and legacy
                    languages, frameworks, and other technologies to eliminate bottlenecks and produce results. And I've learned how
                    to deliver what people really want (which is often times different from what they ask for).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of my technical proficiencies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in 32- and 64-bit assembly language (especially the <a target="_blank" href="http://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> dialect)</li>
                    <li>Proficient in C, C#, C++; some proficiency in Java</li>
                    <li>
                        Proficient in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, MVC, Entity Framework, Code-First Migrations,
                        LINQ, SQL, Razor, AngularJS, Web API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strong background in performance related issues:
                        <ul>
                            <li>CPU internals (Intel architecture), including CPU cache and memory</li>
                            <li>Intel instruction sets</li>
                            <li>File systems and storage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I love pushing the envelope, making things go fast. 
                    I have @Html.ActionLink("8 U.S. patents in my name, and several more pending", "IP", "Home").
                    And I love jumping into the unknown, figuring out how to make things better and more unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Working with People</h3>
                <p>
                    While I thoroughly enjoy coding, I love working with people! I love helping and teaching others.
                    I'm a great team player, and also work well on my own.
                    I've been in charge of, and in the middle of, some incredible development teams.
                    I've managed many dozens of programmers (I know their tricks, and have some of my own).
                    I love my family, and I’ve enjoyed living in Utah for the past almost four decades.
                    With family ties across the country from California to Texas to Pennsylvania, 
                    I’m open to a new adventure in the right place with the right company.
                </p>
                <h3>I'm Ready!</h3>
                <p>
                    So... I've been an entrepreneur in the past, and I'm enjoying expanding my technical coding skills right now.
                    I'm looking for the right position in an entrepreneurial company, whether small, medium, or large.
                    Any company that does NOT advance in entrepreneurially-minded ways will eventually be disrupted
                    by those that innovate; I've disrupted in the past, and I'm ready to do it again!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wherever I go, I bring a unique combination of technical know-how and
                    an entrepreneurial can't-die attitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you haven't heard enough about me, here are some @Html.ActionLink("other fun facts","Other","Home") about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s talk! The fastest way to reach me is by e-mail.
                    I'd love to learn how I can contribute to your company, solving perplexing problems
                    and creating innovative solutions.
                    And if speed and performance are an issue for your company, then contact me AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
                </p>
