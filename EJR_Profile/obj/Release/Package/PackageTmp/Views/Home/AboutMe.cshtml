                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal website! This is my very first website, and it's a work in progress. I make weekly updates,
                    and will soon add some major projects I'm just finishing up.
                </p>
                <h4>Coder Foundry Bootcamp is Torture!</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm currently enrolled in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coderfoundry.com/masterclass/">Coder Foundry Masters Bootcamp</a>
                    in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are in the 8th week of this concentrated web-dev bootcamp,
                    with four more weeks yet to come. In a few days I'll add to this website a couple more projects I'm finishing
                    up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel confident with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, and LINQ. 
                    I'm finishing up my bug-tracker and car-finder apps and will
                    post them soon. We are now getting into Web API and AngularJS, and so by the end of September I will have added a 
                    substantial amount to my technical background.
                </p>
                <h4>Professional Technologies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in 32- and 64-bit assembly language (especially the <a target="_blank" href="http://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> dialect)</li>
                    <li>Proficient in C, C#, C++; some proficiency in Java</li>
                    <li>Increasing proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, MVC, Bootstrap, LINQ, SQL, Razor, AngularJS, Web API</li>
                    <li>I make things go fast</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I know what goes on inside the CPU. 
                    I understand key performance issues related to memory, 
                    CPU cache structures, Intel instruction sets, and file systems and storage. And I know how to use cutting-edge
                    languages, frameworks, and other technologies to eliminate bottlenecks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coding is my personal favorite because I love breaking speed barriers. 
                    Focusing on performance issues is one of my key strong points.
                </p>
                <h4>Working with People</h4>
                <p>
                    I love working with people! I love to help and teach others. 
                    I can be a great team player but also work well on my own. 
                    I've been in charge of, and in the middle of, some incredible development teams. 
                    I've managed dozens of programmers (I know all their tricks, and have some of my own!). 
                    I love my family, and I’ve enjoyed living in Utah for the past 40 years. 
                    And because I have ties to family in many different states now,  I’m up for a new adventure! 
                </p>
                <h4>I'm Ready!</h4>
                <p>
                    So... I've been an entrepreneur in the past, and it's time to come back to my programming roots.
                    Any company that does NOT advance in entrepreneurially-minded ways will eventually be disrupted
                    by those that innovate. Wherever I go, I bring a unique combination of technical know-how and
                    an entrepreneurial can't-die attitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always pushed the envelope. I have <span>@Html.ActionLink("8 U.S. patents in my name, and several more pending", "IP", "Home")</span>).
                    I love making things go fast. I love working. And I also love to jump
                    into the unknown, to find ways to make things better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you haven't heard enough about me, here are some additional <span>@Html.ActionLink("fun facts about me","Other","Home")</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s talk! The fastest way to reach me is by e-mail. 
                    I'd love to see how I can contribute best to your company by solving perplexing problems 
                    and creating innovative solutions. 
                    And if speed and performance are an issue for your company, then contact me AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
                </p>
