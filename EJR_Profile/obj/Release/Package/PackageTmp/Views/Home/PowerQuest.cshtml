                <p>
                    This entry is long. And I haven't yet learned how to create that accordion-like style where
                    you can decide how much of this text you want to see at one time.  But that will come later,
                    once I have some more time to figure it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So please forgive me in advance for the length here,
                    but there are some really great things I just need to say about my experience with my company
                    PowerQuest. After all, I started it in my basement, and with the support of my wife I was able to
                    focus and bring my dream to reality. And I hope you enjoy some of the great links below!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 7 years or so at Gazelle Systems, I realized there was something big, something missing in all the utilities
                    I could find.  And I knew I could create a winner, an idea that would propel my company much further and faster
                    than I previously thought possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A salesman from IBM would visit regularly, trying to get us at Gazelle Systems to try OS/2, which he said would be
                    bigger than Windows. Finally, after maybe his 10th visit with me, I relented. So I backed up my drive, ran FDISK to
                    redo the partitions and create a separate one for OS/2, restored my files, then rebooted. After several hours of
                    this and trying to install OS/2, it croaked, saying there was not enough space on my partition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already had a backup, so I just ran FDISK again and made my C: partition smaller and my D: partitition bigger -- I knew
                    it was big enough, so I restored everything again, rebooted, and then started installing OS/2 again to my D: partition.
                    With fingers crossed,
                    I watched as the last installation disk was inserted, everything went well.  Then the system rebooted, and during
                    the process it croaked again: the partition still wasn't big enough!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I was mad, kicked the OS/2 installation manual across the room (it didn't go very far, it was kinda heavy), and thought
                    there had to be a better way.  And... DING! DING! DING!  I realized I could architect a program that could resize
                    partitions and preserve all the user data, and dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to repartition the drive. This
                    test with OS/2 required over 10 hours, plus tons of frustration, and that made me hate OS/2 even though I had never even
                    had a chance to use it. So I thought IBM would love this product that I would build, because I was certain many
                    others had the exact same frustrations as I did. And this problem must have been hurting their sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long story short... I left Gazelle Systems (over which I unfortunately had lost control due to divorce),
                    having obtained all the rights needed to run with this crazy scheme to repartition drives on the fly. It was interesting
                    that one of the Gazelle's board members said he had heard of others trying to repartition drives, but that it couldn't
                    be done, so he had no problem with my chasing after the partitioning windmill. He and the rest of the board wished
                    me good luck and unanimously signed off on the deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few hours later, PowerQuest was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I applied for a patent on partitioning drives, and was very hopeful. But
                    I was wary of Microsoft, Symantec, Quarterdek, and other potential competitors. So I had to cover all
                    contingencies as best I could, with only a small bundle of cash. An Olympian task, but I knew there had to be a way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose a path that we believed would insulate us from major competitors, and would help us become a big
                    fish in a small pond. I knew IBM would love what I was doing, and in fact I needed their help to obtain key information
                    regarding OS/2's preferred file system, HPFS. We decided to launch in the OS/2 and DOS markets, even though everybody
                    knew those markets were hemorrhaging and ceding ground quickly to Windows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I didn't care, that would be even better,
                    meaning no major competitive threats would notice what was happening in the OS/2 market. And this was key
                    to our plan! We could grow quickly, and then
                    leverage that success as we eventually jumped into the Windows market (our preferred
                    market, after all). A key component of our plan included a graphical interface for DOS, which at the time was
                    almost unheard of. We knew that would get everybody's attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make sure our plan had a chance, I contacted a VP at Symantec and asked him about their
                    plans for the OS/2 market. He told me it was dying and they were leaving it, didn't care to look at it. Additionally, I
                    realized that to be one of the top 10 Windows products, you had to sell 10,000+ units a month. In contrast, to be in
                    the top 10 for OS/2, you had to sell 10 or so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hmm... I thought I could sell maybe 50 our first month. When the product was finally ready,
                    we got our first order from the main OS/2 distributor,
                    <a href="http://davalyn.com/tucibmpc/indelible_blue.html">Indelible Blue</a>... for 400 units!!! We immediately became
                    the #1 product in OS/2, got several awards in the major OS/2 magazines (all three of them), and got several editors to
                    fall in love with us, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a>.  We knew that
                    if Mr. Pournelle liked PartitionMagic, he would write about us in Byte Magazine and help us cross the chasm into the Windows arena.  Which
                    he did, as we took the Best of Comdex Award later that fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company took off. First year we launched Partition Magic: $1.8 million in revenues. We quadrupled the next year to
                    $8.3 million. For our third year, my Sales and Marketing VPs told me that, if we were able to do everythihg just right
                    and everything went our way, we could reach $15 million. So I called a company meeting, and told the company that
                    if we hit $25 million, we would send everyone and their spouse to Hawaii for a week!  My VPs were ready to kill me, the
                    employees loved me, and so we had just under 12 months to make this happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still remember those last two weeks, we were a couple million short. But my team did it, we cleared $25 million in net
                    revenue for the year, more than tripling the previous year. And we went to Hawaii. We had to divide into four groups
                    because we couldn't shut the company down for the week. We had a great time, incredible memories (and if I were a better
                    CEO, I would have gone with all four groups instead of just one). Over the years, our employees and their familes forgot
                    about the cash incentives we gave, but they never forgot Hawaii. It was fun being stopped at the store by grateful wives
                    who said thank you, they never would have gone without us, and it made a huge difference for them.
                </p>

                    I could go on. But this is already too long. So here are some links that help fill in some of the blanks. Needless to say,
                    PowerQuest was a wonderful story, one that I would love to repeat. And I'm looking for the right opportunity to do just that.

                            My friend and VP-Marketing, John Christensen, died several months after writing this and
                            other markting and P/R pieces for PowerQuest. It was so
                            sad to lose a key player on our team.
